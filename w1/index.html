        <h1>Nicholas Elkhaouli</h1>

        <p>One thing about me is that I have a huge passion for cars especfially Bmw's, I own 2 Bmw's, a 2010 bmw 528i and a 2003 Bmw 540i M-sport. Other things I like to do is to hangout with my friends/gf or to play video games and spend some time with myself. </p>
        
        <p>Along with going to school I also work Full time at Electric Boat. When I first started it was hard to balance both school and work at the same time but since then I have been able to manage both of them together. </p>
